@data/processed/dicom_instance_metadata.csv contains dicom instance level data, where each row is a dicom instance. The data has following columns.
file_path,pixel_shape,dimension,shape_str,error,BitsAllocated,BitsStored,Columns,FrameOfReferenceUID,HighBit,ImageOrientationPatient,ImagePositionPatient,InstanceNumber,Modality,PatientID,PhotometricInterpretation,PixelRepresentation,PixelSpacing,PlanarConfiguration,RescaleIntercept,RescaleSlope,RescaleType,Rows,SOPClassUID,SOPInstanceUID,SamplesPerPixel,SliceThickness,SpacingBetweenSlices,StudyInstanceUID,TransferSyntaxUID,SeriesInstanceUID,instance_filename.
SeriesInstanceUID indicates what series does the instance belong to. 
Please help me to do the following analysis:
1. check if IOP are same for all the instances in a series

2. use iop ipp to calculate distance between dicom images in a series remove the scout. save the data togheter with modality; And then calculate the distribution for each modality

Occationaly there is a scout image at the start or end. A charactor of scout image is that it's far from the images, that is, it's distance from other images are very far. Is there a way to detect it?
1. Think hard and try to detecting it in a new script.
2. after removing the scout image, please help me to calculate the distance between 1st and last images using iop ipp, taht is the farest distance between images. Then do a histogram to generate the distribution.
