*task*
given a series of dicom images of head from various modalities (CTA, MRA, MRI T1 post-contrast, T2-weighted), predict the likelihood of aneurysm and in each of the locations. There could be aneurysms in multiple locations.

*Training data*:
4500 brain imaging series from various modalities (CTA, MRA, MRI T1 post-contrast, T2-weighted)
 - each series (as a folder) contains dicom files; 
 - labeled for aneurysm presence across 13 anatomical locations
 - localizer labels for almost all aneurysm series (about 2000). That is (x, y) cooredinates for one 2d slice (dicom) where an aneurys is happening.

 Here are the 13 locations.
  1. Left Infraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery  
  2. Right Infraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery  
  3. Left Supraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery  
  4. Right Supraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery  
  5. Left Middle Cerebral Artery  
  6. Right Middle Cerebral Artery  
  7. Anterior Communicating Artery  
  8. Left Anterior Cerebral Artery  
  9. Right Anterior Cerebral Artery  
  10. Left Posterior Communicating Artery  
  11. Right Posterior Communicating Artery  
  12. Basilar Tip  
  13. Other Posterior Circulation

 There are also 3d segmentation masks for the 13 locations, for 270 out of the 4500 brain series.

 Here is a summary of number series and instances in csv format:
 Modality,Total_Series,Series_With_Segmentation,Series_Without_Segmentation,Segmentation_Percentage,Series_With_Aneurysm,Avg_DICOM_Files,Median_DICOM_Files,Std_DICOM_Files
CTA,1857,74,1783,4.0,997,397.047,331.0,254.597
MRA,1256,41,1215,3.3,557,157.021,164.0,78.514
MRI T1post,306,21,285,6.9,78,154.66,165.0,94.187
MRI T2,986,42,944,4.3,261,30.834,29.0,25.427


Please think hard and help me to consider if it's possible to use DINO v3 to complete this task. How can it be used.
